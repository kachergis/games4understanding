Play is a universal phenomenon in the animal kingdom. From dolphins to dogs, countless species engage in playful activities, and these behaviors are generally understood to be a means of practicing essential life skills. As humans, we have developed an advanced form of play: video games. These interactive experiences are immensely popular, and offer a rich source of naturalistic, skillful, goal-oriented human behavior that is largely untapped by cognitive science. This workshop will explore the hypothesis that video games may serve as the ideal testbed for building and improving unified theories of cognition.
